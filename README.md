INSTALLATION Linux:

Install your platforms Pythondistribution. Remember to chose python 2.x and install all develpment header files.
Run at the command line:

pip install pyephem

Put the Pyalmanac files in any directory and start with:

python pyalmanac
or 
./pyalmanac 



INSTALLATION MAC:

Every Mac comes with python preinstalled. You need to install the PyEphem library to use Pyalmanac. Type the following commands at the commandline (terminal app):

sudo easy_install pip

pip install pyephem

If this command fails your mac asks you if you would like to install the header files. Do so, you do not need to install the full IDE.
Try again.
